## 🚀 Inspiration  
In today’s fast-paced professional world, individuals collect a wide array of certifications, diplomas, and licenses. These documents are often scattered across emails, hard drives, and physical files—easily lost or unverifiable.  
We were inspired to build **CertVault** to provide a **secure, decentralized, and permanent solution** for storing and sharing achievements, using the power of the **Solana blockchain**.

## 🧠 What it does  
**CertVault** is a Solana-based decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to:

- 📤 Upload and store professional certificates, diplomas, licenses, and awards **on-chain**
- 🗂 Organize documents by categories (e.g., Education, Skills, Licenses)
- 🔗 Generate **unique verification links** and **QR codes** for public proof
- 🔐 Control privacy settings (Public/Private)
- ⏰ Set and track expiration dates, **get renewal notifications**, and view an achievement timeline
- 🌐 Showcase achievements via a **shareable portfolio page**
- ✅ Prove authenticity with **immutable Solana transaction hashes**

## 🏗 How we built it  

- **Storage**: On-chain metadata and off-chain file storage using **Arweave/IPFS**, with file hash references stored on Solana  
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana wallet adapter (e.g., Phantom) for authentication and transaction signing  
- **QR & Link Sharing**: Generation of unique Solana-based verification URLs and downloadable QR codes  
- **Notification System**: Frontend-based reminder logic using browser notifications and local storage, expandable to off-chain alerts
- **Built** with the help of AImpact.dev
